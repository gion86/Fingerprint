# FINGERPRINT Garage opener 
### Fingerprint sensor and relay output to open a garage door upon user authentication  
**version 0.9.1**


This project is made of a single main C++ file, which will be compiled for Atmel AVR 
architecture, and control fingerprint sensor (FPS_GT511C1R), with an Attiny84, to drive 
a relay contact. This will open/close my garage door!
